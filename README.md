# How it's organized

The [`akmods` image](https://github.com/orgs/ublue-os/packages/container/package/akmods) is built and published daily. However, there's not a single image but several, given various kernel support we now provide.

Here's a rundown on how it's organized.

We do our best to support all current builds of Fedora, current versions of the kernel modules listed, and in the case of NVIDIA current (550).
**Note: NVIDIA legacy driver version 470 is no longer provided as RPMfusion has ceased updates to the package and it no longer builds with kernel 6.8 which has now released for Fedora 38 and 39.**

The majority of the drivers are tagged with `KERNEL_TYPE-FEDORA_RELEASE`. NVIDIA drivers are bundled distinctly with tag `KERNEL_TYPE-FEDORA_RELEASE-NVIDIA_VERSION`.

| KERNEL_TYPE | FEDORA_RELEASE | TAG |
| - | - | - |
| Fedora stock kernel | 38 | `main-38`, `main-38-550` |
| | 39 | `main-39`, `main-39-550` |
| | 40 | `main-40`, `main-40-550` |
| [patched for ASUS devices](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/lukenukem/asus-kernel) | 39 | `asus-39`, `asus-39-550` |
| | 40 | `asus-40`, `asus-40-550` |
| [patched fsync](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/sentry/kernel-fsync) | 39 | `fsync-39`, `fsync-39-550` |
| [patched Microsoft Surface devices](https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/) | 39 | `surface-39`, `surface-39-550` |
| | 40 | `surface-40`, `surface-40-550` |



# Usage

To install one of these kmods, you'll need to install any of their specific dependencies (checkout the `build-prep.sh` and the specific `build-FOO.sh` script for details.

For common images, add something like this to your Containerfile, replacing `TAG` with one of the `something-FR` tags above:

    COPY --from=ghcr.io/ublue-os/akmods:TAG /rpms/ /tmp/rpms
    RUN find /tmp/rpms
    RUN rpm-ostree install /tmp/rpms/ublue-os/ublue-os-akmods*.rpm
    RUN rpm-ostree install /tmp/rpms/kmods/kmod-v4l2loopback*.rpm

For NVIDIA images, add something like this to your Containerfile, replacing `TAG` with one of the `something-FR-NVV` tags above:

    COPY --from=ghcr.io/ublue-os/akmods:TAG /rpms/ /tmp/rpms
    RUN find /tmp/rpms
    RUN rpm-ostree install /tmp/rpms/ublue-os/ublue-os-nvidia*.rpm
    RUN rpm-ostree install /tmp/rpms/kmods/kmod-nvidia.rpm

These examples show:
1. copying all the rpms from the respective akmods images
2. installing the respective ublue specific RPM
3. installing a kmods RPM.


# Adding kmods

If you have a kmod you want to contribute send a pull request by adding a script using [build-kmod-wl.sh](https://github.com/ublue-os/akmods/blob/main/build-kmod-wl.sh) as an example.

# Verification

These images are signed with sisgstore's [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/). You can verify the signature by downloading the `cosign.pub` key from this repo and running the following command, replacing `RELEASE` with either `38` or `39`:

    cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/ublue-os/akmods:RELEASE
